   # Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The Gaming Room staff requests our team to develop a web-based implementation of the game ‘Draw It or Lose It.’ We will design a game that will:
      •	Have multiple characters on a team
      •	Allow exclusively unique team names; A system for players to check if a name is in use
      •	Allow a single instance of the game existing in system memory at any given state 

   # What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    Evaluations was something that I did particularly well, giving a general list of software architecture for the client.
   
   # What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    I think this was very helpful prior to implementation. It gave me the ability to find elements I wanted to include and not increase the scope, requiring a need to stick to the same concepts described.
   
   # If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    One part that I would revise would be the design constraints part of the document. I would choose to improve it by providing more performance and security contraints as the game went into a mobile state.
  
   # How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    Understanding what the user needs is crucial for maintaining long term patronage for any software. Not implementing the user's needs could cause less adoption of the software as well as possible security issues. I interpret user needs through behaviors that may come up during beta testing.
   
   # How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
     Being able to use the design document as a general guide, that was the main approach to avoid expanding scope or not adding crucial elements. In the future, using git would be helpful to understand the story being written overtime in the softwawre
